    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <div class="updated">Last updated: September 16, 2025</div>



    <h2>1) Platform Role</h2>

    <p>ProBuildZone is a neutral marketplace/connector. We do not employ Pros, do not provide construction services, and are not a party to the agreements between Clients and Pros.</p>



    <h2>2) User Responsibilities</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Clients:</strong> provide accurate project information; comply with applicable laws and permits.</li>

      <li><strong>Pros:</strong> ensure qualifications, licensing, insurance, and compliance with applicable laws; deliver services with reasonable care.</li>

      <li><strong>All users:</strong> use the platform lawfully; do not upload illegal, infringing, or harmful content.</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>3) No Warranties; Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the platform is provided “as is”. ProBuildZone disclaims all warranties (express or implied). We are not liable for: (i) disputes, damages, or losses between Clients and Pros; (ii) workmanship, safety, permits, timelines, or outcomes; (iii) payments, quotes, refunds, or collections. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the platform is to stop using it.</p>



    <h2>4) Payments</h2>

    <p>Unless expressly provided by ProBuildZone (e.g., via a separate checkout), payments are strictly between Clients and Pros. We do not hold client funds, guarantee transactions, or resolve payment disputes.</p>



    <h2>5) Content & IP</h2>

    <p>Users grant ProBuildZone a limited license to host and display uploaded content solely for operating the platform. Users must have rights to any content uploaded and remain responsible for it.</p>



    <h2>6) Account; Suspension</h2>

    <p>We may suspend or terminate access for abuse, fraud, security risk, or legal reasons. You are responsible for maintaining account confidentiality.</p>



    <h2>7) Indemnity</h2>

    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ProBuildZone and its operators against claims arising from your use of the platform, your content, or services you provide/receive.</p>



    <h2>8) Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p>Any dispute is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of USA, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Venue and jurisdiction lie in state and federal courts.</p>



    <h2>9) Changes</h2>

    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. <strong>By continuing to use the platform after updates, you agree to the most recent version of these Terms.</strong></p>
