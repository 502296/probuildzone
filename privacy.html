    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="updated">Last updated: September 16, 2025</div>



    <h2>1) Overview</h2>

    <p>ProBuildZone (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides a platform that connects homeowners (“Clients”) with service providers (“Pros”). We respect your privacy and process only the minimum personal data needed to operate and improve the platform.</p>



    <h2>2) Data We Collect</h2>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> name, email, phone (if provided).</li>

      <li><strong>Project data:</strong> titles, descriptions, addresses (optional), images, videos, documents, blueprints.</li>

      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> device/browser info, pages viewed, actions taken (for security and analytics).</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>3) How We Use Data</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Provide core features (project posting, secure file storage, controlled access for Pros).</li>

      <li>Match Clients and Pros and enable communications between them.</li>

      <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, comply with legal obligations.</li>

      <li>Send service emails (e.g., account notices); you can opt out of non-essential emails.</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>4) Ownership & Access</h2>

    <p>Clients retain ownership of their project content (including files). By uploading, you grant us a limited license to host and display your content within the platform for its intended purpose. Access to project details is restricted; Pros only see masked data until shortlisted by the Client, after which access may be granted using time-limited signed URLs.</p>



    <h2>5) Sharing</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>We do not sell personal data.</li>

      <li>Data is shared with Pros only as authorized by Clients (e.g., when a Pro is shortlisted).</li>

      <li>We may use trusted processors (e.g., cloud hosting, storage, email delivery) under data-processing terms.</li>

      <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>6) Security</h2>

    <p>We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures (private storage buckets, role-based access, signed URLs, logging). We also encrypt files at rest and communications in transit. However, no system is 100% secure.</p>



    <h2>7) Your Choices & Rights</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>Access, update, or delete your account data.</li>

      <li>Control who can view your project details (shortlisting Pros).</li>

      <li>Request deletion of files; removal may affect project visibility.</li>

    </ul>



    <h2>8) Children</h2>

    <p>Our platform is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required by local law).</p>



    <h2>9) International Users</h2>

    <p>We operate in the United States. By using the platform, you consent to processing in the U.S. If applicable, we aim to align with major privacy frameworks (e.g., CCPA/GDPR principles) in plain-language practice.</p>
